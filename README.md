###Camera Input
This is a little helper repo for opening the computer camera with HTML5 and capturing a snapshot.
Additionally there is a widget to upload a photo from local storage and show it in a canvas.

##To run
- clone this repo and cd into it
- `http-server` (please install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) before or serve from your own server)
- goto `localhost:8080`

##Notes
- !Please note that the video stream does not work if serving the file at "file:///Users..", you will need to serve the file. I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) npm package for this purpose.
